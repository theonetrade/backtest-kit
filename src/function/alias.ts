/**
 * ============================================================================
 * ACTION-SCOPED SIGNAL LISTENERS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * `listenSignal` / `listenSignalLive` / `listenSignalBacktest` deliver the whole
 * `IStrategyTickResult` union, which forces every subscriber to re-open the same
 * `if (event.action === "...")` branch before it can touch a variant-specific
 * field. These aliases pre-split each emitter by the `action` discriminator, so the
 * callback receives an already-narrowed member of the union: `pnl` and `closeReason`
 * are simply present on a `listenSignalClosed` event, no guard required.
 *
 * Three families, one per emitter:
 * - `listenSignal<Action>`         — all events (live + backtest)
 * - `listenSignalLive<Action>`     — Live.run() only
 * - `listenSignalBacktest<Action>` — Backtest.run() only
 *
 * Seven actions: Idle, Scheduled, Waiting, Opened, Active, Closed, Cancelled.
 *
 * Each also ships a `...Unique` variant taking `(filterFn, fn)`, which fires the
 * callback once per NEW signal rather than on every emission:
 *
 *   listenSignal<Action>(async (event) => {
 *     if (!filterFn(event)) return;   // 1. condition
 *     if (alreadySeen(event)) return; // 2. collapse repeats
 *     await fn(event);                // 3. deliver
 *   })
 *
 * Each per-signal form wraps the matching plain alias rather than building its own
 * observer chain, exactly like the `listenXOnce` forms in `function/event.ts`. The
 * plain alias owns the single `queued()` wrapper, so the dedup check runs INSIDE
 * that queue, in step with the callback. A private `.filter().connect(queued())`
 * chain would evaluate the dedup at emit time instead, deciding for a whole burst
 * of events before the first callback had run.
 *
 * Deduplication is keyed on the execution identity, not the bare signal id:
 *
 *   strategyName:exchangeName[:frameName]:backtest|live:symbol  ->  signalId
 *
 * (frameName is omitted when empty, exactly like the Cache key helper.) A single
 * process runs several strategies, symbols and modes through the same emitter, so
 * a per-execution slot is what keeps interleaved traffic from clobbering the state
 * of another execution.
 *
 * `Idle` has no per-signal variant: an idle tick carries `signal: null`, so there is
 * no identity to deduplicate on. Use the plain `listenSignalIdle` form instead.
 *
 * Every function returns an unsubscribe function.
