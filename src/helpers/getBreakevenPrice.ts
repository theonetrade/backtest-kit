/**
 * Computes the exact COST-AWARE breakeven price — the close price at which the
 * realizable PNL (toProfitLossDto, i.e. slippage + fees + multiplier + DCA
 * entries + partial-close replay included) equals exactly 0%.
 *
 * The raw effective entry price is NOT breakeven: closing there realizes the
 * round-trip costs as a loss of (CC_PERCENT_SLIPPAGE + CC_PERCENT_FEE) * 2
 * (≈ -0.4% at defaults, scaled by the leverage multiplier). A stop-loss meant
 * to protect capital must sit at the price where the TOTAL trade exits at
 * zero — for LONG slightly above the effective entry, for SHORT slightly
 * below it.
 *
 * Method (mirror of getLiquidationPrice): pnlPercentage is LINEAR in
 * priceClose for a fixed signal state — already-closed partials contribute a
 * constant, the remaining position a linear term, and the fee/slippage
 * adjustments are linear too. Two evaluations of toProfitLossDto recover the
 * line (slope k, intercept b), and the breakeven price is the solution of
 * k * P + b = 0. This inverts the REAL production PNL calculator, so the
 * formula can never drift from it (closing at the returned price yields
 * exactly 0% by construction).
 *
 * Returns null when the PNL does not depend on the close price (k ≈ 0): the
 * remaining position weight is zero (fully closed by partials) — nothing left
 * to protect. A non-positive solution (unreachable with banked partial
 * profits exceeding the remaining exposure) also returns null.
 *
 * @param signal - Signal with position/priceOpen/multiplier and optional _entry/_partial
 * @returns The exact zero-PNL close price, or null when breakeven is undefined
